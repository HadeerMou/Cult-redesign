          <h4>"The Importance of Responsive Web Design in 2024"</h4>
          <p>
            In today’s digital landscape, a website is often the first point of
            contact between a business and its customers. As more people access
            the internet through smartphones, tablets, and various devices,
            having a responsive web design is no longer optional—it's essential.
            In 2024, user experience, mobile-first design, and SEO performance
            are heavily dependent on how well a website adapts to different
            screen sizes. Here's why responsive web design is more important
            than ever this year.
